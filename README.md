# Revised-Base-System
Proposing a new base system as the current base system is flawed in many ways. 
According to some reddit users the current bases are defined as:

0.5 - Physical contact, may include holding hands and kissing of other non-intimate areas such as cheeks

1 - Kissing / Making out

2 - Touching boobs

3 - Any kind of genital interaction except intercourse (manual or oral)

4 (Home base)- Sex

### Proposed system
This newer system will reduce the ambiguity and allow "bros" to communicate their adventures more precisely and with less effort.

1 - Kissing (Lips)

1.5 - Touching/groping boobs but over the clothes

2 - Touching/groping boobs

2.5 - Touching/groping the genitals but over the clothes

3 - Handjob/fingering (not necessarily to completion)

3.5 - Oral sex

4 (Home base)- Sex (As it has always been)

There can also be progressions of 0.25 between these bases if one partner does this but the other does not reciprocate.
